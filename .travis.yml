# Build on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Server Edition 64 bit (Trusty Tahr) which is
# currently on beta (instead of precise which is current default):
dist: trusty

# Build inside docker containers instead of virtual machines. These are
# faster, start quicker and support caching. Downside: sudo is not supported
sudo: false

# We cannot use 'sudo apt-get' to install missing apt-packages, see:

git:
  # Travis CI clones repositories to a depth of 50 commits, which is only
  # really useful if you are performing git operations.
  # We restrict to just top level commit, because we are not interested in git
  # operations and fetching the history could be quite large.
  # Please note that if you use a depth of 1 and have a queue of jobs, Travis
  # CI wonâ€™t build commits that are in the queue when you push a new commit.
  depth: 1

  # Don't clone the `examples/` submodule:
